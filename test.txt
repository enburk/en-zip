  etymology == 
    From Middle English ''moven'', Middle English ''moeven'', Middle English ''meven'', borrowed from Old French ''mover'', Old French ''moveir'' and Old French ''mouver'', Old French ''moveir'' (“to move”) (compare modern French French ''mouvoir'' from Old French Old French ''movoir''), from Latin ''movēre'', present active infinitive of Latin ''moveō'' (“move; change, exchange, go in or out, quit”), from Proto-Indo-European ''*mew-'' (“to move, drive”). Cognate with Lithuanian ''mauti'' (“to push on, rush”), Sanskrit ''मीवति'' (''mī́vati'', “pushes, presses, moves”), Middle Dutch ''mouwe'' (“sleeve”). More at muff. Largely displaced native ''stir'', from Middle English ''stiren'', Middle English ''sturien'', from Old English ''styrian''.
