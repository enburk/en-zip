            Usage notes:
     * Many languages have [[singular]] for one item and plural for more than one item. Some languages also have a [[dual]] form for two, a [[trial]] form for three, or a [[paucal]] form for several (e.g. [[Fijian]]). Other languages do not distinguish any of these categories.
    <br>
    * While the plural form generally refers to two or more persons or things, that is not always the case. The plural form is often used for [[zero]] persons or things, for fractional things in a quantity greater than one, and for people or things when the quantity is unknown.
    <br>
    * In English, the plural is most often formed simply by adding the letter "[[s]]" to the end of a noun, e.g. [[apple]]/[[apples]]. There are many exceptions, however, such as [[echo]]/[[echoes]], [[mouse]]/[[mice]], [[child]]/[[children]], [[deer]]/[[deer]] (same word), etc.
