society

proposal
: What do you take me for? How dare you make such a proposal to me?

: Society is now one polished horde /// Formed of two mighty tribes, the bores and bored.

: Society--civilized society, at least--is never very ready to believe anything to the detriment /// of those who are both rich and fascinating

: Always! That is a dreadful word. It makes me shudder when I hear it.

faithful
faithless
: Young men want to be faithful, and are not; old men want to be faithless, and cannot: that is all one can say.
: Those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love: it is the faithless who know love's tragedies.

: Should an English person appear to make an embarrassing effort
