homonym

  noun == (''plural'' '''homonyms''')
    # (''semantics, strict sense'') A word that both sounds and is spelled the same as another word.
    # (''loosely'') A word that sounds or is spelled the same as another word, technically called a ''homophone'' (same sound) or a ''homograph'' (same spelling).

  usage notes == 
    : Homonyms (in the broader sense) are divided into the two overlapping subcategories homographs and homophones. Examples:
    :: ''die'' and ''dye'' (homophones but not homographs)
    :: the ''parasitic'' ''flatworm'' called the ''fluke'', the fish called the ''fluke'', and a ''fluke'', part of the tail of a whale (both homophones and homographs and therefore true homonyms in the strict sense)
    :: the metal ''lead'' and the present tense of the verb ''lead'' (homographs but not homophones)
