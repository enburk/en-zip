  etymology == 
    May derive from a Latin ''Io,'' with the I written over the o, placed at the end of an exclamation to mark it as such. The ''Io'' may either be an abbreviation for Latin ''interiectiō'' (“interjection”), or else the interjection Latin ''iō'' (“hey!”). It expresses ''admiration'' in the sentence clause(s), in the Latin sense, of awe or wonderment.
