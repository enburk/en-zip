/// Eyas Originated as a Linguistic Mistake https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/eyas
/// Eyas is a funny-sounding word that exists because of a mistake.
/// In the 15th century, Middle English speakers made an incorrect assumption about the word neias, which comes from the Anglo-French niais ("fresh from the nest").
/// "A neias" sounded like "an eias" to their ears, so the word lost that initial "n," eventually becoming "eyas."
/// (There are other words in English that were created in this same fashion; for example, "an apron" used to be "a napron.")
/// The change in spelling may have been suggested by other Middle English words like "ey" ("egg") and "eyry," which was a spelling of "aerie," the hawk's nest where an eyas would be found.
